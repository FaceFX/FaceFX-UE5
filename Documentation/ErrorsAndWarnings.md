Animation Import Errors
-----------------------

##### FaceFX compilation folder does not exist

You need to compile your **.facefx** file with the FaceFX Runtime plugin for FaceFX Studio. This is what creates the **.ffxc** folder. When this error occurs, an invalid FaceFX actor asset is created. Be sure to delete or update it.

##### Importing audio asset failed

Make sure you only analyze **.wav** files from FaceFX Studio. UE5 can not import **.ogg** files for example.

##### Audio file does not exist

The audio associated with the animation can not be found. The path to the audio comes from the **.ffxamap** file in the **.ffxc** folder. Paths are relative to the **.facefx** file path, and the **.facefx** file's path is relative to the path listed in the **Documents\FaceFX Studio 2018\facefx.clientspec** file. If your audio file does actually exist (check that first), this could be due to an error in your **facefx.clientspec** file if it has been modified by hand. Make sure the capitalization is correct (drive letters should be capitalized for example).

Animation Import Warnings
-------------------------

##### Skipped **.ffxanim** file with no audiomap entry. It may have been moved or deleted.

This warning occurs when the files in your **.ffxc** folder get out of sync. Do not modify, add, or delete files from the **.ffxc** folder. Even opening the folder should be avoided because it will prevent the FaceFX Runtime plugin for FaceFX Studio from deleting it when appropriate. Performing a *Rebuild all* will fix the issue. Also, avoid using the same filename for different **.facefx** files.

##### Linked animation asset does not contain an audio map entry. It may have been moved or deleted. Consider to delete that animation asset.

An animation that was previously imported and linked to the actor is no longer present in the actor. If the animation was deleted from the **.facefx** file, you will need to manually delete the Unreal asset.
